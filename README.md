"The app to review movies and lose friends"

This program is designed to allow users to review movies and see their friends' reviews.  Although a similar app exists in the form of letterboxd, this app differs in that users only see reviews from friends, removing the flood of random strangers' reviews.  Thus, this app emphasizes the social aspect of movies.

Users are able to search for movies using omdb (open movie database).  Having found a movie, users may rate (.5 - 4 stars) and provide reviews (long-form text essays) for it.  They are also able to see their individual friends' ratings and reviews for the same movie (feature pending!).  Aggregate information about their friends ratings is displayed: the average review for this movie among all friends, among "good tasters", and among "bad tasters."  Users may label a friend as being a "good taster" if they generally agree with their opinions and vice versa for "bad taster."

Before that, you may run the app by plugging in your android phone via usb to your computer. Open the project in Android Studio, and choose "run app".  This will prompt you to use your phone, which will run the program.
