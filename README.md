"The app to review movies and lose friends"

This program is designed to allow users to review movies and see their friends' reviews.  Although a similar app exists in the form of letterboxd, this app differs in key ways:

- Users only see reviews from friends, removing the flood of random strangers' reviews.
- Users are able to post questions on movies.  Friends who have seen the movies will receive alerts (and ideally answer the questions)
- Users have access to long-form film analysis (currently not available on rotten tomatoes, imdb, or wikipedia)
